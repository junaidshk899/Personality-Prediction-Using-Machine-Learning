# üß† Personality Prediction Using ML

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict a person‚Äôs personality type (Introvert or Extrovert) based on behavioral and social features like time spent alone, social event attendance, going outside, post frequency, etc.

## üîç Features Used
- Time Spent Alone  
- Social Event Attendance  
- Going Outside  
- Friends Circle Size  
- Post Frequency  
- Stage Fear  
- Feeling Drained After Socializing  

## üß™ Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve & AUC

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `data_preprocessing.py` ‚Äì Data cleaning, encoding, and splitting  
- `models.py` ‚Äì Model training and evaluation  
- `visualizations.py` ‚Äì Correlation heatmap, ROC, confusion matrix  
- `ann_model.py` ‚Äì Neural Network implementation

## üß† Output
The model accurately classifies users into Introvert or Extrovert with high performance across different algorithms.

## ‚úÖ Dependencies
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- tensorflow / keras (for ANN)
